# Travel Website with Gemini, YouTube, and Weather APIs

Welcome to the Travel Website project! This project integrates Gemini API for chat functionality, YouTube API for video content, and Weather API for real-time weather updates. The project is built using React and Tailwind CSS for the front-end and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the back-end.

## Project Structure

- **Front-End**: Contains the React application with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Back-End**: Contains the Node.js server with Express, which interacts with MongoDB and the various APIs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below to set up both the front-end and back-end environments.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB
- NPM or Yarn

### Setting Up the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tech-skil/Chat-miniprojrct.git
cd Chat-miniprojrct


#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

You will need to create environment files for both the front-end and back-end.

##### Front-End

Navigate to the `front-end` directory and create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

##### Back-End

Navigate to the `back-end` directory and create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
EXPRESS_API_KEY=your_express_api_key
```

Replace the placeholders (`your_youtube_api_key`, `your_gemini_api_key`, `your_weather_api_key`, `your_mongodb_uri`, `your_express_api_key`) with your actual API keys and URI.

#### 3. Install Dependencies

##### Back-End

Navigate to the `back-end` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

##### Front-End

Navigate to the `front-end` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Running the Application

##### Front-End

To run the front-end project, navigate to the `front-end` directory and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the React application.

##### Back-End

To run the back-end server, navigate to the `back-end` directory and execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and it will be available at `http://localhost:5000` by default.
